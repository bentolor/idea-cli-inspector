= Adjusting & Building Docker-Images for IntelliJ IDEA CLI Inspector
Benjamin Schmid, <setec@gmx.net>

== Analyzing project using the Docker version of idea-cli-inspector

There is an image `bentolor/idea-cli-inspector` available on Docker Hub which
you can use to start and run `idea-cli-inspector` without any further
configuration. The project to be analyzed is expected to be available in
`/project` within the running container. Example usage:

====
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/project  bentolor/idea-cli-inspector -rf pom.xml -p inspectionprofile.xml
====

== General overview creating your own Docker containers

The `Dockerfile` provided in this repository will create a minimum,
Java-based Docker environment which is able to run a IDEA CLI
inspection.

It is based on

* IntelliJ Community Edition (vanilla)
* AdoptOpenJDK Java 11

In your practical usage scenario you might probably have different
needs like:

* Using the commercial Ultimate Edition for more support
* using additional inspections provided by plugins
* additional Tooling (like NodeJS)

This guide tries to explain how to customize your idea-cli-inspector
instance.

NOTE:: link:https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/docker-intellij-inspect[@sylvainlaurent/docker-intellij-inspect]
 created a very similar approach which is in some aspects more advanced
 than this implementation. You might also have a look there.


== Visually installing/adjusting IDEA settings

IntelliJ stores its settings in a `IdeaIC2018.3/config` directory
(or `.IntelliJ2018.3/config` for Ultimate editions). Most of these
settings do not matter so they are excluded in the `.dockerignore`
file.

But if you want i.e. install additional plugins, set the licence
server for the Ultimate Edition or add/define additional SDKs you
can do this interactive.

Therefore just run

```
xhost si:localuser:root 
docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
          -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix  \
          -v `pwd`/home:/home \
          bentolor/idea-cli-inspector su ideainspect -c '/srv/idea.latest/bin/idea.sh'
```

This will launch IDEA inside the docker container. After configuration check the
modifications in `home/ideainspect` and add them to the Container (i.e. adjusting
`.dockerignore`).
