# Apply an "Custom scope" for the analysis run
# This is _the prefered way_ to limit your inspection run to a part of your project files
# as it takes effect within IDEA itself.
# See: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/specify-inspection-scope-dialog.html
#
# HOWTO:
# 1) Create a new scope excluding undesired folders/files (node_modules, doc, ...)
# 2) Share the .idea/scopes/scopename.xml with the project
# 3) Use the _name_ of the scope (not the file).
# 4) Stick to a single word for best compability
scope: inspector-code

# Inspection result files to skip. For example "TodoComment" or "TodoComment.xml".
#
# NOTE: This does not have an effect on which inspections are effectively run by IDEA!
#       For the sake of performance better disable these inspections within your 
#       inspection profile. This here is a last-resort mechanism if you want them
#       to appear in your IDE but not your CI process
skip: TodoComment,Annotator

# Ignore issues affecting source files matching given regex. Example ".*/generated/.*".
#
# NOTE: This does not have an effect on the places IDEA looks. Therefore please prefer
#       declaring an "scope" and exclude those locations via the IDEA scoping mechanism
#       for the sake of performance.
#       This here is a last-resort mechanism if you have no other options to supress 
#       specific places/warning.
